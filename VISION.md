# Why TR Code?

The digital world lacks a universal method of attribution.  
TR Code is a lightweight, verifiable layer for embedding authorship and rights into media.

It protects creators. It informs consumers.  
It helps platforms do the right thing.

TR Code exists to standardize provenance in a way that respects privacy, portability, and persistence.
